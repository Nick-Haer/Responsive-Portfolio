        <p class="leftline"> Welcome to my Web Developer portfolio! Before learning to create websites, I worked as an
            archaeologist and then with a nonprofit focused on the rights of immigrants. My background in conservation
            and aid work now provides my motivation for creating beautiful and effective websites. With each project, I
            aim to create something that can inform, connect, or assist, and can do it without losing a focus on
            elegant design.
        </p>

        <p> I'm currently studying how to make websites through SMU's coding bootcamp, with a focus on learning
            JavaScript and using the MERN stack to make clean and responsive wesites. The projects you can visit here
            are part of my classwork, some designed individually and others in groups, with each dedicated to mastering
            a new concept through project based learning, </p>

        <p>This portfolio showcases some of the projects I'm most proud of. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I
            enjoyed creating them! If you have any questions about how the websties on my portfolio were made, or have any
            kind of feedback regarding them, please let me know by filling out the message form under contacts. Thanks for visiting!
